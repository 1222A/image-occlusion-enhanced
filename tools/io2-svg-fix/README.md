## Fix Old Image Occlusion 2.0 Cards

Notes created with older versions of Image Occlusion 2.0 contain malformatted SVG files that are no longer supported by platforms such as iOS and Android. This add-on fixes the corresponding SVG files.

**USAGE**

1. (Highly recommended): Create a backup of your entire note collection including your media files. You can do this by [exporting your collection](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#exporting-packaged-decks)
2. Install the add-on
3. Click on Tools → *Fix Old Image Occlusions*, read the message that comes up and hit *OK* if you want to proceed
4. Perform a sync to apply the changes to your mobile devices. In some cases you might have to add or remove an image first for a full media sync to trigger.
5. You can remove the add-on at this point if you don't plan on importing any additional old Image Occlusion 2.0 notes

**ADDITIONAL NOTES**

Please consider upgrading to [Image Occlusion Enhanced](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111933094) to avoid issues like these in the future.
