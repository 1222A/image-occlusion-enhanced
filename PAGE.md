## Overview

Image Occlusion is an add-on for the spaced repetition flashcard program [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/). It allows you to create flashcards that hide parts of an image and test your knowledge on the hidden information.

This is the landing page for *Image Occlusion Enhanced*, an updated version of the [original Image Occlusion add-on](https://github.com/tmbb/image-occlusion-2).

## Credits

Most of the credit for this add-on goes to [Tiago Barroso (tmbb)](https://github.com/tmbb) who developed the original Image Occlusion and Image Occlusion 2.0. *Image Occlusion Enhanced* would not exist without him.

I would also like to thank the following contributors:

- [Abdolmadi Saravi](https://bitbucket.org/amsaravi/) for patching Image Occlusion to reuse existing images in the media collection and on notes
- [Ank_U](https://bitbucket.org/Ank_U/) for modifying Image Occlusion to support more fields
