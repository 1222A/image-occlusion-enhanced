This is the add-on page for *Image Occlusion Enhanced*, an updated version of the [Image Occlusion 2.0 add-on](https://github.com/tmbb/image-occlusion-2) for Anki.

*Image Occlusion allows you to create cards that hide parts of an image and test your knowledge on the hidden information. The cards generated by this add-on are best described as graphical cloze-deletions.*

**Changes compared to Image Occlusion 2.0**

- new tabbed interface
- ability to create image occlusion notes based on old notes
- new "labels" layer for creating custom labels
- advanced keyboard controls
- multi-line entry fields
- new buttons for adding notes
- new note type with more fields
- ability to customize field names
- synchronization between image occlusion editor window and Anki's editor
- remember last used directory

...and many many other bug fixes and improvements. 

To get a full grasp of how these changes might affect your workflow I'd advise you to give the [official README](https://github.com/Glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced) a careful read-through.
