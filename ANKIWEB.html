<em>Image Occlusion Enhanced</em> is an updated version of the <a href="https://github.com/tmbb/image-occlusion-2" rel="nofollow">Image Occlusion 2.0 add-on</a> for Anki.

<em>Image Occlusion allows you to create cards that hide parts of an image and test your knowledge on the hidden information. The cards generated by this add-on would be best described as graphical cloze-deletions.</em>

<strong>Changes compared to Image Occlusion 2.0</strong>
<ul><li>new tabbed interface</li><li>ability to create image occlusion notes based on old notes</li><li>new "labels" layer for creating custom labels</li><li>advanced keyboard controls</li><li>multi-line entry fields</li><li>new buttons for adding notes</li><li>new note type with more fields</li><li>ability to customize field names</li><li>synchronization between image occlusion editor window and Anki's editor</li><li>remember last used directory</li></ul>...and many many other bug fixes and improvements.

To get a full grasp of how these changes might affect your workflow I'd advise you to give the <a href="https://github.com/Glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced#changes-compared-to-the-original-add-on" rel="nofollow">official README</a> a careful read-through.
